# openpoimap

This is the code for version 1.28 of OpenPoiMap - aka **Taglocator**.
It is a tool to show on the OSM map a number of predefined POI's from a number of the standard OSM tagging scheme as defined
in the wiki at: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features.<br>
This tool is a user-friendly approach to the underlying database of OSM.<br>
In addition to this, it is possible to define your own key:value pairs to search for.<br>
I started working on this tool in november 2014.<br>
Update 1.28 (9 november 2016) relates to the changes that we're necessary to call mapillary.
